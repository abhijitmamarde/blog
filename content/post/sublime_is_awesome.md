# Sublime is Awesome

I feel sublime text is the most versatile and awesome editor for 
writing code and in general for any type of text (including `markdown`).

### Why I love it

1. `Small setup` size ~5 MB.
2. Works seamlessly across `different platforms` Windows/Mac/Linux.
3. `themes` which are easy on eye.
2. Supports **syntax highlighting** for most of languages *out of Box*.
3. Has built in **spell check** functionality.
4. *Multiple Cursors*. Instead search/replace, select replace multiple occurrences once.
5. Quick searching (based on indexes) of filenames, symbols, contents etc.
6. Rich set of Plugins and Settings.
6. Excellent support for editing **Markdown** files via [this](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/MarkdownEditing) plugin.
   * Supports even GFM (GitHub flavored Markdown) syntax.
   * Has key-bindings for adding different markdown entities.


>So all-in-all `Sublime Text` is a **must tool** for any developer!
